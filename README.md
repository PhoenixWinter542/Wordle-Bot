# Wordle Bot 
## Setup
This program requires a SQL Server database containing your word list.  
You can find lists of english words here:
- [All english words (Not all words are accepted by wordle)](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)  
- [Scrabble words](https://boardgames.stackexchange.com/questions/38366/latest-collins-scrabble-words-list-in-text-file)

Once the database is running you have to edit the app.config in "Wordle Helper .Net Framework/" to point the program to the word column of your database.  
 ``` xml
 <connectionStrings>
	<add name="connection" connectionString="server=DESKTOP-SV6S892;trusted_connection=Yes"/>
	<add name="table" connectionString="english.dbo.scrabble"/>
	<add name="column" connectionString="words"/>
</connectionStrings>
```
## Running
Start by typing out your first guess. \
Next fill in the feedback given by wordle. \
You can cycle colors using the arrow keys, mousing over a letter and left/right clicking, or mousing over a letter and scrolling.\
Once you have entered the feedback click submit or hit enter.

The Suggestion will fill the current row. You can either provide the wordle feedback or use backspace to delete the suggestion.\

The program is deterministic and will always give the same suggestion given the same inputs.
